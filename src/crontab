# Torii cron tab
#
# Uses the same syntax like vixie-cron for the cron definitions, and associates
# optionally grouped tasks with the schedule definitions.
#
# The tasks are specified as <group>:<task>, while no tasks of the same group
# will be executed in parallel. The task definitions can be found in the
# directory tasks/. The task name is the name of the respective task definition
# file without the extension.
#
# To execute the cron jobs run `./bin/cron`. You might want to add this to your
# real crontab, like this:
#
# # * * * * * ./bin/cron
#
# The Torii cron runner (periodic) will ensure that the tasks are not executed
# twice in parallel or called too often.
